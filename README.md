## Demo

To test out our algorithm, follow these steps:

a) Clone our repository

b) Download all the libraries required into a python virtual environment

    pip install -r requirements.txt

c) Run our streamlit web app

    streamlit run app.py

d) Input your API key in the .env setting

    API_KEY = <Your_API_Key>

Upload your video and wait for our algorithm to do its work!  (The first set-up will take a while due to the downloading of models.)
